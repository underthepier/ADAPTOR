# Python Data Analysis Package for the Kestrel 5500 weather meters

## Overview
This package is intended to streamline the data analysis process by automating certain tasks
<br>

Originally developed in response to challenges faced during importing and cleaning data from multiple kite-based sensors as part of the [NASA funded AREN project](https://www.globe.gov/web/aren-project)

## What's included:
### A data preprocessor
A data preprocessing tool to quickly obtain and visualize the desired data

`New User Version` - this file is intended to be teaching material: a "gentle introduction" to data analysis using data from the Kestrel as an example

#### Interactive plots
##### EXAMPLE 1 - Selecting and viewing data
Quickly visualize selected data to efficiently proceed to next steps
